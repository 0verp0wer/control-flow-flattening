### control-flow-flattening
- The first open source control flow flattening tool written in Python

### ‚ùì You have got an error?
- If you encounter an error, that's normal.
- This control flow obfuscator only works with very simple files.
- It was released for educational purposes only, and as of now, I don't plan to update it.

### ‚ùó Why I released this code?
- No one had ever publicly released a control flow obfuscator written in Python, so I thought it might be useful to release one for educational purposes.
- This control flow obfuscator was originally created for use in my new VM challenge, [Cyron](https://github.com/0verp0wer/Cyron). However, after several tests, I realized that integrating it into the VM would require too many registers, leading to a drop in performance.
